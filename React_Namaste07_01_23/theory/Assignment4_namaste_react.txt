1. Is JSX mandatory for react ?
A: JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment.
   Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children). So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.
   The component can either be provided as a string, as a subclass of React.Component, or a plain function.If you get tired of typing React.createElement so much, one common pattern is to assign a shorthand:
   If you use this shorthand form for React.createElement, it can be almost as convenient to use React without JSX.

2. Is ES6 mandatory for react ?
A: No ,Its not mandatory 

3. {TitleComponent}  Vs  {<TitleComponent/>}  Vs  {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
A: <TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>   and <TitleComponent/>   mean one and the same .

4. How can I write commentsin JSX ?
A: // or  //**  **/

5. What is <React.Fragment><React.Fragment/>  or <></>   ?
A: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM
   For example : render() {
                     return (
                       <React.Fragment>
                             <ChildA />
                             <ChildB />
                             <ChildC />
                      </React.Fragment>
                            );
                          }

  There is also a new short syntax for declaring them.
  Those are referred to as Empty tags . Usage of empty tag is depicted below 
  For example : render() {
                     return (
                       <>
                             <ChildA />
                             <ChildB />
                             <ChildC />
                      </>
                            );
                          }
  
6. what is virtual DOM ?
A: Representation of real DOM .When we render an application user interface, 
   React creates a virtual DOM tree representing that UI and keeps it in memory. 
   On the next update — in other words, when the data that renders the app changes — React will automatically create a new virtual DOM tree for the update.

7. what is Reconcialiation in react ?
A: When we render an application user interface, React creates a virtual DOM tree representing that UI and keeps it in memory. On the next update — in other words, 
   when the data that renders the app changes — React will automatically create a new virtual DOM tree for the update.After React creates the new virtual DOM tree, 
   it compares it to the previous snapshot using a diffing algorithm to figure out what changes are necessary. This process is called reconciliation.

8. What is React Fiber ?
A: React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster and smoother. React is one of the popular JavaScript library used to create a  
   responsive user interface. React makes coding simple as compared to other frameworks. After certain changes 
   who is the next element to render the system called reconciler. This algorithm helps to compare two DOM trees and diff them. React fiber helps to do it better.

9. Why do we need keys in React ?
A: whenever react is updating the dom ,with many sibling then you add one more child then react 
   must re render everything ,but if we give unique keys to then the react will do less work,
   by just rendering the new child with a new key comparing with the existing key. 

10. Can we use index as keys in React ?
A:  Yes we can use indexs keys in React but its not recommended to use indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact
    performance and may cause issues with component state. 
    If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.

11. What is props in React ? Ways to
A:  React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
    To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:

    Add a "brand" attribute to the Car element:
    const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;

    The component receives the argument as a props object:
    Use the brand attribute in the component:

   function Car(props) {
        return <h1>I am a {props.brand}!</h1>;
                       }

12. What is config driven UI ?
A: config driven UI - WHEN WE BUILD A REAL WORLD APPLICATION,
   WE CANT HAVE DIFFERENT WEBSITE ALL OVER COUNTRY,
   WE CONTROL UOR CONTENT THROUGH CONFIG DRIVEN UI ,
   Who is driving this content ? backend , that is api
   we will build through config only since its a real world example
